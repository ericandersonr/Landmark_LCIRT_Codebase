#### Python Code for Streaming Eye Tracker and fNIR data based on the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) ####

The LCIRT Lab has developed a solution for collecting synchronous data from multiple synchronized research tools as well as user mouse movements. The solutions developed for the Eye Tracker and fNIR tools are shared here with the hope that it will aid others in their research eforts.

###### About the Lab Streaming Layer
The lab streaming layer (LSL) is a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments 
that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, (near-) real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, 
viewing and disk recording of the data.

###### About the Lab:
The Landmark College Institute for Research and Training (LCIRT) actively engages in discovery and applied research on 
issues related to diverse learners, including those with learning disabilities (such as dyslexia), attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The unique populations of students at Landmark College 
inform and guide our research interests. https://www.landmark.edu/research-training
